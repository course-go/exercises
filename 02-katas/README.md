# Katas

This exercise guides through solving a couple of katas that relate to the lecture.

### Katas

The module includes a couple of katas in the `internal/katas` directory. The katas also contain auxilery functions, type, and data in the subdirectories which you are free to explore, but should not edit in any way. Each kata contains a brief description of the problem which should be fixed.
