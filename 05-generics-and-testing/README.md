# Generics

The goal of this exercise is to practice generics in Go.

## Steps

### Installation

1. Download Go.
    - Consult your package manager. If it provides a up-to-date version of Go install it using it.
        - MacOS [brew]: `brew install go`
        - Ubuntu [apt]: `sudo apt install golang-go`
        - Arch [pacman]: `sudo pacman -S go`
        - Windows [cocolatey]: `choco install golang`
    - If your package manager does not provide you with Go package or if it is not up-to-date, install Go manually using [the official guide](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. Verify your installation.
    - `go version`
3. Choose your IDE.
    - If you are fan of JetBrains tools you can use their dedicated IDE for Go, [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).
    - If you prefer VS Code just install the [VS Code Go](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) plugin.
    - If you are old school or you just like staying in your terminal using vim/neovim with [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) is also an excelent choice.
